FASHION DATASET DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS SUMMARY
==================================================
This script has created instruction files for all required datasets.
Due to access restrictions and large file sizes, you need to manually download most datasets.

Recommended datasets to prioritize for your research:
1. DeepFashion or DeepFashion2 - Large, well-annotated datasets with attributes
2. Evaluation3 - Contains outfit aesthetic ratings (good/normal/bad)
3. Print14 - For texture and pattern analysis
4. TypeAware - Fashion items organized into categories

After downloading the datasets, run the preprocessing script to prepare them for training.
